# haskell-trees

This is a library made as an exercise for the Function Programming in Haskell course of the University of Glasgow.

The library exposes a `Tree` data structure and some functions to work with it.
Tests were made to ensure those functions behavior as expected.

## How to run the test project

- Install GHC and Cabal. Easiest way may be using [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/).
- Run `cabal test` in the root folder of the project.
